‚≠ê Real Time Chat ‚≠ê 
</h1>
üí¨ A real time chat application using C# dotnet, SignalR, RabbitMQ, Identity and some other technologies and patterns. This is a coding challenge üë®‚Äçüíª

## Code Challenge

##### Assignment
üìå The goal of this exercise is to create a simple browser-based chat application using .NET.
This application should allow several users to talk in a chatroom and also to get stock quotes from an API using a specific command.

##### Mandatory Features
<ul>
	<li>‚úî Allow registered users to log in and talk with other users in a chatroom.</li>
	<li>‚úî Allow users to post messages as commands into the chatroom with the following format /stock=stock_code</li>
	<li>‚úî Create a decoupled bot that will call an API using the stock_code as a parameter
(https://stooq.com/q/l/?s=aapl.us&f=sd2t2ohlcv&h&e=csv, here aapl.us is the
stock_code).</li>
	<li>‚úî The bot should parse the received CSV file and then it should send a message back
	into the chatroom using a message broker like RabbitMQ. The message will be a stock quote
using the following format: ‚ÄúAPPL.US quote is $93.42 per share‚Äù. The post owner will be
the bot.</li>
	<li>‚úî Have the chat messages ordered by their timestamps and show only the last 50
messages.</li>
	<li>‚úî Unit test the functionality you prefer.</li>
</ul>

##### Bonus (optional)
<ul>
	<li>‚úî Have more than one chatroom.</li>
	<li>‚úî Use .NET identity for users authentication.</li>
	<li>‚úî Handle messages that are not understood or any exceptions raised within the bot.</li>
	<li>‚ö†Ô∏è Build an installer. <b>=> I used docker-compose to build and run the application, i'm not sure if that counts</b></li>
</ul>

##### Considerations
<ul>
	<li>‚úî We will open 2 browser windows and log in with 2 different users to test the
functionalities.</li>
	<li>‚úî The stock command won‚Äôt be saved on the database as a post.</li>
	<li>‚úî The project is totally focused on the backend; please have the frontend as simple as you
can.</li>
	<li>‚úî Keep confidential information secure.</li>
	<li>‚úî Pay attention if your chat is consuming too many resources.</li>
	<li>‚úî Keep your code versioned with Git locally.</li>
	<li>‚úî Feel free to use small helper libraries.</li>
</ul>

##### Bugs not resolved
The following bugs were yet not resolved.
<ul>
	<li>‚ùå When sending message to the other user, an error is being registered on console.</li>
	<li>‚ùå When executing the API from docker container and opening the swagger page, it is not loading the routes. If its executed from the project IDE it works.</li>
</ul>

## Demonstrations
I have recorded some GIFs to demonstrate how the application works:

##### Register and Login

##### Two different users logged and chatting

##### Stock Command

## Technologies and Patterns
üõ† These are all the technologies and patterns i used to develop this application
##### BackEnd
- [C# .NET 6.0 Web API](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [SignalR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MassTransit.RabbitMQ/8.0.6-develop.537)
- [Identity](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity)
- [Mediator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MediatR)
- [FluentValidation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentValidation)
- [AutoMapper](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoMapper)
- [MassTransit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MassTransit/8.0.6-develop.537)
- [Refit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Refit)
- [Polly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly)
- DDD
- CQRS
- Middlewares: Error, Request and Response
- Dependency Injection

##### FrontEnd
- [C# .NET 6.0 Web](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript)

## Requirements
To execute and run the local application, you will need to download and install the following:
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/#download-and-install)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/compose-desktop/)

If you want to execute the project from Visual Studio, you must also have the following:
- [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [SQLServer](https://www.microsoft.com/pt-br/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

## Executing the Project
To execute the project, follow the steps below:
1. Run Docker Desktop.
2. Open the command prompt (cmd), navigate inside the project "\src" folder, and type: "docker-compose build" to build the application.
3. Type "docker-compose up -d" to start the application containers.
4. Now you can execute the application:
	1. To run the Web Application, navigate to http://localhost:8080
	2. To run the Web Api, navigate to http://localhost:8082/swagger 

to stop the execution of the containers, type "docker-compose down"
